Make Automation Using Arduino Uno R3
The specification is:
1. Arduino uno r3
2. soil humidity Sensor
3. LCD 1602
4. RTC DS3231 
5. ac dimmer
6. Adapter 12v
7. RELAY MODUL 1 CHANNEL
8. SOLEOID VALVE
9. JUMPER CABLE
10. Cable AWG

This system operates by controlling the opening and closing of a solenoid valve, regulated by an RTC module and humidity sensor. It encompasses two conditions: firstly, regulating the valve to release water from the reservoir during the morning and evening. Secondly, opening the solenoid valve to irrigate the soil when the humidity sensor detects dry conditions.
